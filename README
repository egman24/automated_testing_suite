PHILOSOPHY:

"Page Tests"
"Flow Tests"

'Pages' don't exist without context and purpose within 'flows',
but they do need to be fully tested out for functionality.

Have modular buffet of page test nested in proper places during flows.

Flow -- should be atomic and modular:
    - guest perusal
    - registration
    - login

FEATURES:

browser suites

    * Give command line option to run full browser suite, or a specific browser.
    * Figure out how to note all browser versions and how to switch between easily

CLI UI

    * Make the Ui.title_logo customizeable by test suite
         -- example -- base case test suite, then scidea 2.0, scidea 3.0, legacy
    * Abstract the ui class out of source control of core as 'custom themes'? load if exists, if not default value
