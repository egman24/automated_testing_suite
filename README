PHILOSOPHY:

"Page Tests"
"Flow Tests"

'Pages' don't exist without context and purpose within 'flows',
but they do need to be fully tested out for functionality.

Have modular buffet of page test nested in proper places during flows.

Flow -- should be atomic and modular:
    - guest perusal
    - registration
    - login


Iteration 1:

Deploy flows {

Register
Take course
See learner capture response
Claim credit

}

EVENTUALLY MAKE MODULES and CLASSES TO REPRESENT
    FLOWS (user getting things done),
    PAGES (all options on one static page/url)
    * remember, both of these can be different when State is different ==>
        ENV variables/
        SESSION variables/
        ADMIN and CONFIG settings/
        DATA

FEATURES:

distribute work

    * if i could cli to manipulate vms and local browsers in mac env -- i would be able to run all browsers
    * print out ENV variables, browser version variables, driver version variables... that would be excellent

browser suites

    * :ie tag will run in linux but use default ff.... make conditional based on os?
    * Give command line option to run full browser suite, or a specific browser.
    * Figure out how to note all browser versions and how to switch between easily
    * make it a CLI option at what point to close browser windows to do away with session/cookies...
        - after each elemental test,
        - after test suite of all instances in one browser,
        - after one instance in one browser

CLI UI

    * Make the Ui.title_logo customizeable by test suite
         -- example -- base case test suite, then scidea 2.0, scidea 3.0, legacy
    * Abstract the ui class out of source control of core as 'custom themes'? load if exists, if not default value
